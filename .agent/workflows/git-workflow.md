# Git Workflow Rules

Before making any changes in this workspace, follow these rules:

## Rules

1. **Always confirm commit message with user before pushing to GitHub**
   - Before running `git commit` and `git push`, ask the user what commit message they want
   - Do NOT assume or auto-generate commit messages
   - Wait for user approval before pushing

## Example

When pushing changes:
1. Make the code changes
2. Ask: "What commit message would you like for this change?"
3. Wait for user response
4. Only then commit and push with the confirmed message
